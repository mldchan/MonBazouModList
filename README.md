# Mon Bazou Mod Menu

> This project is currently unfinished and in the early stages of development. Features may be missing and there may be bugs here and there.

## Features:

- [x] **Mod List**: A mod list displays a list of mods, allows disabling of mods that support it, displays additional information, and allows changing configurations of mods, all from within the game.
- [ ] **Console**: A console that connects to Unity's Debug.Log function and allows you to log debug messages and view them in-game instead of having to alt-tab to the console window. Also have the console pop up when a mod fails.
- [ ] **More features, up to your suggestions!** More features, up to your suggestions! Discuss new features or problems in the Discussions tab!

## Contributing

To contribute, fork the repository, make your changes, and open a pull request. I'll look at it, make sure the code doesn't contain anything malicious, and then merge it.

If you want to support me financially, I have an active Ko-fi page at https://ko-fi.com/mldkyt. I'm also in the process of setting up GitHub sponsorships, once I have that set up, I'll update this page to include that as well.
