# Mon Bazou Mod List

> This project is currently unfinished and in the early stages of development. Features may be missing and there may be bugs here and there.

## Planned/Current Features:

- [X] **Mod List**: A mod list displays a list of mods, allows disabling of mods that support it, displays additional information, and allows changing configurations of mods, all from within the game.
- [X] **Console**: A console that connects to Unity's Debug.Log function and allows you to log debug messages and view them in-game instead of having to alt-tab to the console window. Also have the console pop up when a mod fails.
- [ ] **Downloadable Mod List** - A list of mods that are on NexusMods, with their descriptions, with a link that goes to NexusMods.
- [ ] **More features, up to your suggestions!** More features, up to your suggestions! Discuss new features or problems in the Discussions tab!

## Contributing

To contribute, fork the repository, make your changes, and open a pull request. I'll look at it, make sure the code doesn't contain anything malicious, and then merge it.

If you want to support me financially, I have an active Ko-fi page at https://ko-fi.com/mldkyt. I'm also in the process of setting up GitHub sponsorships, once I have that set up, I'll update this page to include that as well.

You can reach me on my [Discord server](https://mldkyt.nekoweb.org/discord/)! The discord server requires members to be verified by introducing themselves to the staff team, and the staff team will look at and verify all new members.

We have a dedicated channel just for this project, and any discussion is welcome in that channel. Every single one of my projects has its own channel, and we also have general chat channels that are not related to any project.
