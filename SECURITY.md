## Supported Versions

We strive to maintain the latest possible build and fix bugs in it. Any older builds are a no-go.

| Version  | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| latest   | Yes!               |
| previous | No                 |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can use the Issues tab on GitHub to report vulnerabilities. You can do your best to describe the problem so that we can fix it as much as possible.

If you feel that the vulnerability you're reporting is more serious, you can report it privately.
